App for automatic playlists creation in spotify based on track-list from comments

I have really good telegram channel that posts small music paylists each week, but the audio file in telegram is not convinient for me, i decided to create an app that automatically creates playlist in spotify based on track-list from comments.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for now I've only made data parsing from string (in the future i will it get from comments) and creating playlist with tracks from that string.
